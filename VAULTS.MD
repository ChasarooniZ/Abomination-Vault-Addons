#### G10. Urevian's Domain
- Generally recommend following some of the advice from Abomination Vaults: Expanded <sup>[AV:E](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/418672/The-Abomination-Vaults-Expanded)</sup>
  - Replace Urevian's bodyguards with [Levalochs](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1114)
  - Use the **Amicia Rajani** character so that there is more of anguish about whether or not to sacrifice Carman, and also an option of who to sacrifice
  - Increase his offered reward to closer to what **AV:E** recommends based on your party's knack for sacrificing people
  - Have him as a latter ditch effort threaten the players with Demontide if they don't cooperate "

**In Tower**
- Sign post the tower Powering up (cool shaking, VROOOM, Energy Flowing)
- Have Urevian's Voice blare out of the tower head and say something like. "I hate to do something this brutish, but you have left me no choice, We'll see how long your precious town can hold out"
- Then they are now desparately going up (rewards players to have teleport spot activated, and allows you to Foreshadow escaping the tower)
**On Way to Town**
-  Can narrate beams of energy flying out from the tower (launching demons into town)
- Sky Darkening (If running eclipse)
**At Town**
- Now you can start off with some characters dead etc,
**Post Fight**
- Now there are factions in the town who don't trust or like the PCs allowing more conflict at the Mayoral Election stuff if run
## H - Farm
## I - Hunting Grounds
- Caliddo
  - Theme everything he has with cold
  - For his final confrontation, have him fight the party one the Lake riding his steed
  - Take some creative liberty and have his steed freeze a 10 ft. emanation wherever it stops in its movement, this way he will have somewhere to stand post its death.
### Yldaris
Major changes IMO are neeeded here, the AP treats it as 1 part room by room combat encounter, and 1 part Length Exposition Dump. IMO both are pretty bad, and overall how it's integrated isn't great 
## J - Temple
