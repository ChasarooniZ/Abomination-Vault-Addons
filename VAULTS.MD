#### G10. Urevian's Domain
- Generally recommend following some of the advice from Abomination Vaults: Expanded <sup>[AV:E](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/418672/The-Abomination-Vaults-Expanded)</sup>
  - Replace Urevian's bodyguards with [Levalochs](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1114)
  - Use the **Amicia Rajani** character so that there is more of anguish about whether or not to sacrifice Carman, and also an option of who to sacrifice
  - Increase his offered reward to closer to what **AV:E** recommends based on your party's knack for sacrificing people
## H - Farm
## I - Hunting Grounds
### Yldaris
Major changes IMO are neeeded here, the AP treats it as 1 part room by room combat encounter, and 1 part Length Exposition Dump. IMO both are pretty bad, and overall how it's integrated isn't great 
## J - Temple
