## **Session 1: The Gauntlight**
**Rowan**, a human wizard, **Braum**, an orc champion, **Fact**, a dwarf Alchemist, and **Mirakk**, a Tengu Swashbuckler, were called by **Wrin Sivinxi** to investigate a strange light on the **Gauntlight**, a mysterious inland lighthouse deep in the **Fogfen** swamp. The party accepted the request and set off to the swamp. After navigating through the swamp, the party reached the _Gauntlight_ and encountered small creatures called **Mitflits**, who initially attacked them.
After a few encounters with the creatures, the party found their leader and was able to negotiate a deal with them, in exchange for some gems the party was to reclaim the _Mitflits'_ old home underneath the lighthouse that had been taken over by **Morlocks**.
The party agreed to help the _Mitflits_ and started to look for a way down to where the _Morlocks_ were dwelling.
## **Session 2: Exploring the Gauntlight**
After the 3 week break, the party noticed that the light house seems a big brighter and decides to adventure back into the light house. Arriving at the lighthouse, the party starts to go to the unexplored rooms. In the first room, stonescale spirits suddenly appeared. However with the brains of Braum and the intimidation of Rowan, the party successfully scared them away. The party goes to another unexplored room where they find the top of the lighthouse but the door is locked. There also seems to be a blood stain in this room that seems to be alive and bubbling. The party continues to explore and goes into the next unexplored room and find keys. The party also finds 2 secret doors. The party decides to leave the secret paths for now and continue exploring the rooms. In the next room, the party finds an altar. When the party approaches the altar, skeletons suddenly attack. After defeating the skeletons, the party sees more building in the back where they decide to investigate. The party sees a boat house where we see traces of other life forms recently. Then the party goes to the shed and see a ghost. The ghosts is vehemently saying they want shiny. The party decide to follow the ghost's directions and go to the room to retrieve the shiny. In the room, there is a cute bird puppet who asked if they are its masters. Fact says they are not and a battle begins. It was a rough battle where the party realized they all suck at hitting. (Mirakk panache, Facts punch, Rowans missiles) After the battle, we retrieve the shiny and interrogate the ghost who happens to be a fae instead? We keep the shiny thing and let the fae go. We decide to go back to town to recuperate.
