## **Session 1: The Gauntlight**
**Rowan**, a human wizard, **Braum**, an orc champion, **Fact**, a dwarf Alchemist, and **Mirakk**, a Tengu Swashbuckler, were called by **Wrin Sivinxi** to investigate a strange light on the **Gauntlight**, a mysterious inland lighthouse deep in the **Fogfen** swamp. The party accepted the request and set off to the swamp. After navigating through the swamp, the party reached the _Gauntlight_ and encountered small creatures called **Mitflits**, who initially attacked them.
After a few encounters with the creatures, the party found their leader and was able to negotiate a deal with them, in exchange for some gems the party was to reclaim the _Mitflits'_ old home underneath the lighthouse that had been taken over by **Morlocks**.
The party agreed to help the _Mitflits_ and started to look for a way down to where the _Morlocks_ were dwelling.
## **Session 2: Exploring the Gauntlight**
After the 3 week break, the party noticed that the light house seems a big brighter and decides to adventure back into the light house. Arriving at the lighthouse, the party starts to go to the unexplored rooms. In the first room, stonescale spirits suddenly appeared. However with the brains of Braum and the intimidation of Rowan, the party successfully scared them away. The party goes to another unexplored room where they find the top of the lighthouse but the door is locked. There also seems to be a blood stain in this room that seems to be alive and bubbling. The party continues to explore and goes into the next unexplored room and find keys. The party also finds 2 secret doors. The party decides to leave the secret paths for now and continue exploring the rooms. In the next room, the party finds an altar. When the party approaches the altar, skeletons suddenly attack. After defeating the skeletons, the party sees more building in the back where they decide to investigate. The party sees a boat house where we see traces of other life forms recently. Then the party goes to the shed and see a ghost. The ghosts is vehemently saying they want shiny. The party decide to follow the ghost's directions and go to the room to retrieve the shiny. In the room, there is a cute bird puppet who asked if they are its masters. Fact says they are not and a battle begins. It was a rough battle where the party realized they all suck at hitting. (Mirakk panache, Facts punch, Rowans missiles) After the battle, we retrieve the shiny and interrogate the ghost who happens to be a fae instead? We keep the shiny thing and let the fae go. We decide to go back to town to recuperate.

## **Session 3: A bloody good time**
After taking one final small respite, the party is awakened by Wrin who warns the party to "Beware the Seven Fingered Hand" and tells them to return to the Gauntlight to uncover the terrible mystery there. Upon arriving to the keep, the party is met by darkness and is ambushed from the pool of blood at the bottom of the tower by a strange bloody facsimile of the "Lady of the Light". The party realizes attacking it isn't working and attempts other methods of dispelling the haunt, prompting Braum to use the power of his holy shield to exorcise it. After the exorcism, the party climbs the lighthouse to investigate the light at the top, where they encounter a vampiric cloud of bloody mist. The cloud wreaks havoc amongst the party, being nigh immune to Braum and Mirakk's efforts and greatly threatens Rowan and Fact's lives. A particularly nasty strike renders Fact unconcious. Despite his best efforts, Fact barely manages to cling to life as he crawls along the ground and attempts to staunch the bleeding. Though unsuccessful, he manages to hold on long enough to survive. Rowan manages to slip away from the mist and proceeds to blast the monster with Magic Missile over, and over, and over again until it eventually succumbs to the barrage. Upon the monster's defeat, the Gauntlight suddenly fixates onto a graveyard on the west side of Otari, raising the dead that lay buried there. The party quickly returns to Otari and are tasked with dispatching the risen dead. The Skeletons seems resistant to magical effects, but Rowan's lightning returns the Zombies to their graves with ease. Fact blasts one with with his crossbow as Braum and Mirakk dart between the undead, bashing and stabbing them one after another. As all of the undead fall, a strange spider-like creature is summoned by the Gauntlight's beam......
## **Session 4: Spider vs. 4 party members ðŸ‘Š**
As the spider-like creature is summoned, it attacks the party. As Rowan tries to distance himself from the spider, he seperates from the party. This however results in the spider rushing him and knocking him out. Exchanging hits from both side (spider and party), Fact ends up being knocked out too. After a rough battle with the spider, the party emerges victorious with a lot of injuries. Once the battle ends, the guards inform the party that the mayor had called for a meeting. The party goes to the meeting. At the meeting, the mayor voices his concerns about the monsters summoned from the Gauntlight. He commissions the party to investigate the Gauntlight and prevent it from shining again.
## **Session 5: OP leech, another doll, and the ghoul gang**
Exploring the space under the boathouse, the party comes across a giant leech creature coming from a torture device. While trying to fight it off, it bites into Braum dealing a ton of damage and then draining his blood for the _**entire**_ remainder of his health and almost fully healing itself. Through a feat of heroism, he gets back up only to be knocked down again by more of his blood being sucked. After a bit of misreading the leech's weaknesses from Rowan, the leech one-shotting Mirakk as well, and Fact picking them up with healing potions, Braum manages to shove the leech away long enough for the group to escape and close the door behind them.
After a brief respite to heal our wounds, we decide to go back down, but take the other path. Upon entering the 2nd room, we find a strange mirror that isn't reflecting us, but is reflecting a weird doll that isn't present in the real world. Despite numerous warnings not to touch the mirror by Fact, Braum touches it anyway. This initiates a strange battle of sorts where a now possessed Braum started attacking the group while a ghostly form of Braum explored the room within the mirror. We manage to delay for a while by tripping and restraining Braum, and ghost Braum manages to break some chains holding the weird doll in place. After a while, Mirakk decides Braum is taking too long and goes into the mirror after him causing his body to get possessed as well. Upon reaching the doll, Mirakk picks the lock on the last chain and they escape out with the doll in Braum's hand. They regain control of their bodies just as Rowan and Fact were being chased down the hall we came through.
The party continues down another flight of secret stairs found in the room with the mirror. Upon reaching the bottom, they come across another set of stairs going back up, a room with a weird white fog (that Mirakk describes as the "cum fog") at one end of a hall, and a closed door at the other end. Deciding that the fog is too ominous, they start sneakily peaking through the door to see what's in there, but they can't see much in the dark other than that there are a few pointy eared, bald things in that room. Braum sneaks past to play around with some mildew covered barrels in a supply closet, and (while trying to follow Braum) Mirakk and Rowan get caught. After a breif exchange of words from the creature and Mirakk squaking, a battle ensues where Mirakk and Braum do most of the damage, Rowan completely runs out of spells and has to bonk one of them with his staff for the killing blow, and Fact (after shanking one of the enemies in the back with his dagger) manages to crit one with his crossbow for 2 damage.
Despite ending the fight successfully, the sounds of other enemies can be heard coming toward them from the direction of a mysterious gauntlight colored tendril at the south end of the room.

## _**Session 6: Retreat**_
The party is immediately attacked the two ghouls and ghoul wizard that were standing around the gauntlight colored tendril in the library. After a brief engagement the party determines these enemies are too powerful to defeat at their current state so they retreat. After spending some time to recover the party decides to explore the other stairwell to the basement of the lighthouse, where they encounter a group of morlocks. The party is able to defeat most of the enemies, however one escapes and alerts its comrades the the party's presence. The party decides to retreat again, this time deciding to go back to Otari so they can rest and recover their resources.
