### I'm starting running Abomination Vaults, any tips?

**_Chasarooni_**
- IF you Use XP consider cutting encounters or using slow levelling (1200 XP) if your party is completionish otherwise they'll end up being about 1 level above the vaults close to floor 5 or 6.
- Introduce Belcorra/signs of her early, really lead into her soshe doesn't just randomly appear
- Consider more ways to loop back into the town (IMO out of the box its very underbaked)
 - On that note there are some Major Town Plot Points
   - **Ch 2.** Deadtide for Otari
   - **Ch 5.** The Theft
   - _AV:E_ **Ch. 5** The Theft Jr
   - **Ch. 7**  Dorianna's Posession
   - **Ch. 8** Demontide for Otari
   - _AV:E_ **Whole AP** The Consortium Conspiracy
 - AV:E (Abomination Vaults: Expanded) comes with a town fair to introduce you to everyone which can help a lot
    - It also has good guidance for some changes early in the vaults,  but I'd recommend picking and choosing what you like based on what fits for you
 - generall y many encounters will say `"They fight until slain"`, I'd recommend generally ignoring that text unless it seems appropriate for the encounter, and if your party seeks it letting them find an alternative solution for the encounter
 - Also go to the AV Discord thread on the PF2e FVTT server as its a great place to bounce ideas

My advice is to find ways to connect your PCs with the citizens of Otari early on. Either prompting them to have some pre-existing relationships in their backstories or creating some social encounters when they are in-town. 
Have the PCs run into Carman Rajani being a general asshole around town. It'll make their decision with Urevian much more interesting if they have a history with him. Arrange for them to meet Keeleno to learn about his situation with Jaul. Introduce Dorianna Menhemes early so they are more invested in her when she is cursed. Maybe her father, the mayor, would like one of the PCs to tutor her. Have Wrin offer to do some fortune telling for the party if you want to gently guide them towards some specific action. Drop some rumors about the missing dudes from the Thieves' Guild. Tell one of your PCs that they are a long-time friend of Lasda and worried about him. etc.
to encourage engagement with the town, make it very easy to come and go from the Gauntlight. It is just a 15-20 minute walk. Don't let them just sleep in the Gauntlight without good reason, and if they do, make it a little difficult for them

**_Kras Mazov_**
Something that I wish I'd done sooner is if a player is investigating (and you should encourage them to do so) as theyre exploring, you should explicitly convey what the rooms were previously i.e. before dilapidation i.e. whats offices, whats the spa etc. As its not clear for just the descriptions given or the map. Give them some history they may have figured out if they could read all the GM background or just looked at the name of the map.
On a different note, does anyone actually like Wrin or think she's a good hook? I feel like someone else with an actual plot link to the vaults would be better.

**_Weepingminotaur_**
- Trim combat encounters whenever you can if they aren't relevant to the storyline, particularly in book 3.
- Foreshadow Dorianna, Carman, Jaul, Caliddo, and VOLLUK especially. What happens to Volluk is by no means clear even from the stuff written, and he is a very tough out for most on-level parties, so it's important for them to know a bit about his bullshit. At least after the first time he kills multiple PCs and sends the rest running. ðŸ˜‰
- Emphasize the Nhim horror. Not enough of it in the AP as written.
- Don't be afraid to make the dungeon reactive, but don't overdo it. It's a balance.
- Kiting is an important combat strategy in AV, with all the tough solo moderate or severe encounters. If your party doesn't know how to kite, prod/teach them.
- More pain points: dooms of tomorrow, shuffling scythes, black pudding, and Urevian having wall of force on his spell list.


**_YoSoy-Ed_**
I would say, give the players clear expectation of the campaign. There are huge RP opportunities missed that you can adjust but it would mean extra job, not running rawish. My players ( and me as a player) are a bit picky about plotholes and dumb to pick clues. There is a lot of info hidden for the players, find a way to expose that to them. In my case I wrote journals for Volluk, Belcorra and Jafaki, videogame style, for example.
A couple of complains is the ghouls paralysis and wisp magic immunity, you may want to modify that.

But town stuff and NPCs probably most important.  Make them feel connected.  I also took Jaul out of the dungeon cause I thought it was stupid he was there and made him an outdoor encounter to give them a break from the dungeon.

### Is this AP very difficult?
- This can depend on your group, it definitely has many encounters that can be difficult, but you are also able and expected to flee from an encounter, so if your party knows when to cut their losses and regroup it can make it less so.
- Also some character such as a Holy Cleric or Champion, can make this AP much easier
- Emphasize the Nhim horror. Not enough of it in the AP as written.
- Don't be afraid to make the dungeon reactive, but don't overdo it. It's a balance.
- Kiting is an important combat strategy in AV, with all the tough solo moderate or severe encounters. If your party doesn't know how to kite, prod/teach them.

### XP or Milestone?
- IF you Use XP consider cutting encounters or using slow levelling (1200 XP) if your party is completionish otherwise they'll end up being about 1 level above the vaults close to floor 5 or 6.
