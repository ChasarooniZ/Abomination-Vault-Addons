Curse Illusion Magical Mental Auditory

*Outside there was a sound of multitudinous little patterings. They had been coming, I was aware, for a long time, and in my sleep they had first become audible. I sat there nervously wide awake as though I had not slept at all. It seemed to me that my breathing came with difficulty, and that there was a great weight upon the surface of my body.*

Even the briefest of encounters with dread Nhimbaloth's presence is enough to affect the health of the unwary. This curse causes you to hear whispering voices, footsteps, and other odd noises during your next long rest. If left untreated, the loss of sleep starts to take a toll on your wellbeing.
